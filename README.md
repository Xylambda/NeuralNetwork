# NeuralNetwork
Simple feedforward Neural Network.

### How does it work?
The model is created based on n layers. A layer is a set of numbers that represents the weight and bias matrices.

The model computes feedforward and backpropagation. It also has a non-stochastich gradient descent algorithm to update
the weights and biases.

## What is the output?
The model outputs the cost function in real time.

## Is it possible to use this model?
Yes, but keep in mind that this model is not meant to be used, but to learn how the core concepts work. It is very slow. I suggest you to use an automatic differentiation library to create your models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
